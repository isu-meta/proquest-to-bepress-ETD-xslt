# proquest-to-bepress-ETD-xslt
This is XSLT written to transform ETD metadata in XML from ProQuest's ETD format to a format suitable for upload to a bepress institutional repository, following local practices at Iowa State University.  All procedures have been adapted from those descibed in Shawn Averkamp and Joanna Lee's 2009 Code4Lib article "Repurposing ProQuest Metadata for Batch Ingesting ETDs into an Institutional Repository" found at http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/1647.
